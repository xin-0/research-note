## Q before talk
- What is total variation distance
- What is product distributions
- What is the algorithm
	- What kind of property does it use

## total variation distance 
aka. statistical distance
$$d_{TV}(P,Q):={\frac{1}{2}}\sum\limits{\vert P(\omega) - Q(\omega)\vert}=\max{\{P(\omega)-Q(\omega),0\}}$$

## product distribution

$P = P_{1}\otimes...\otimes P_{n}$
