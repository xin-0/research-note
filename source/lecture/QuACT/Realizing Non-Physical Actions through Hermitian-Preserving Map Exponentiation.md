## key

Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation algorithm:
- implement one of the non-physical map, Hermitian preserving map, on quantum device.
## before the talk

How does the Hermitian outputed?
Output the Hermitian as Hamiltonian of a system. Not violating the CPTP constrain of a quantum channel.

Hermitian Map Exponentiation Algorithm

## Application

### Entanglement detection
$P_A$: Positive map on a subsystem A

$$P_{A}\otimes I_{B}(\rho)\ngeqslant 0 $$
Has negative eigen-value --> Entangled

### Entanglement Quantification
What is the task
