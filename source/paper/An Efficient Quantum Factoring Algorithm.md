how to verify that (1) represents a Lattice?
- Closed under addition
	- For $Z=(z_{1}, ... ,z_{d})\in\mathcal{L}$ and $Z'=(z'_{1}, ... ,z'_{d})\in\mathcal{L}$ we have $Z + Z' = (z_1+z_1',...,z_d+z_d')$ and $(\prod_i{b_i^{z_i+z_{i'}})^{2}} = (\prod_i{b_i^{z_i})^{2}}(\prod_i{b_i^{z_{i'}})^{2}}=1 \mod N$.  Thus, $Z + Z' \in \mathcal{L}$.
- For this specific lattice, since each $b_i$ are chosen such that is co-prime to $N$. Exists $r_i$ such that $b_i^{r_{i}}=1 \mod N$. $\{r_i\}_i$ forms a basis for the Lattice.
