## 1.1 Modeling Computation
Advantages of Turing's model
1. Robustness of definition.
2. Fluidity of algorithm/machine. An algorithm can be an input to another algorithm.
3. Existence of an universal machine that can efficiently simulate other machines.
4. Due to 2 and 3, it's easy to discuss uncomputability in this framework.
